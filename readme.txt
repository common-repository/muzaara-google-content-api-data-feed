### Content API in Merchant Center ###
The Content API for Shopping allows apps to interact directly with the Merchant Center platform, vastly increasing the efficiency of managing large or complex Merchant Center accounts. The Content API for Shopping can be used as an input source for product data in Merchant Center, directly delivering your data as it is updated on your site.

Google Merchant Center helps you get your shop and product info into Google and make it available to shoppers across Google. That means that everything about your shops and products is available to customers when they search on a Google property.

### Provide your most accurate product data ###
Use the most up-to-date and complete information you have to build trust with your customers.

Maintain up-to-date price and availability, including tax and shipping, by using automated feed delivery (including intraday updates), the Content API, or structured data markup. Customers will leave your site if they don’t see the price or availability they expect. Mismatches will also cause disapprovals.
Provide the most detailed product_type values that you have and values for the google_product_category attribute that are at least 2-3 levels deep. Arrange your product type to start with a broad group and end with a more specific group. Avoid adding synonyms, search query terms, or promotional text. Products should only be categorized by type. For example: Apparel & Accessories > Clothing > Outerwear > Coats & Jackets > Denim Jackets.
